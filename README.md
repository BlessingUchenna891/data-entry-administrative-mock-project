# MOCK PROJECT
# Customer Records Data Entry & Administrative Operations Project

# Role Simulated:
Data Entry Specialist | Administrative Support (Remote)

# 📌 Project Overview

This mock project simulates a real-world remote data entry and administrative support role. The objective was to accurately enter, validate, clean, and manage customer and operational records while meeting productivity, accuracy, and confidentiality standards.

The project also demonstrates hands-on experience with CRM systems, Excel-based data management, reporting, and performance tracking.

# 🎯 Project Objectives
1. Processed and validated 1,250 customer records at an average rate of 250 records per hour across focused review sessions, including error detection, correction, and quality checks.
   
2. Clean and validate raw datasets to eliminate errors and duplicates

3. Maintain organized digital records and administrative documentation

4. Track productivity and performance metrics

5. Generate reports to support administrative decision-making

# 🗂️ Dataset Description

The simulated dataset contained 1,200+ records, including:

i. Customer ID

ii. Full Name

iii. Email Address

iv. Phone Number

v. Location

vi. Order ID

vii. Order Date

viii. Order Status

ix. Assigned Support Agent

x. CRM Status

xi. Notes / Remarks

# 🛠️ Tools Used

1. Microsoft Excel – data entry, validation, formulas, sorting, filters

2. CRM Tool – mock CRM / spreadsheet-based CRM

3. Power BI – basic dashboards

4. PDF tools – document handling and organization

# ✅ Tasks Performed
# 1. Data Entry & Record Management

Entered customer and order data into Excel and CRM systems

Maintained consistent formatting and naming conventions

Updated existing records based on new information

Processed an average of 250 records per hour

# 2. Data Validation & Cleaning

I cleaned and validated 1,250 customer records by resolving invalid emails, phone numbers, duplicate email addresses, inconsistent text casing, and date formatting issues using Excel formulas, filters, and data validation tools:

a. I used Excel string functions to clean email addresses by removing disallowed characters from the username portion while preserving domain integrity, ensuring CRM-compatible formatting.


b. Assuming .com is my, I implemented Excel logic to auto-correct missing domain extensions by appending ".com" only when an email lacked a valid suffix, reducing manual corrections during CRM imports.

c. To Flag rows that still fail after cleaning as invalid, I cleaned and validated email records using Excel string functions, implementing post-cleaning validation logic to flag residual invalid entries for manual review, improving CRM data integrity.

d. I invalidated all the phone numbers containing alphabets using excel formula.
After normalizing local phone numbers, I applied validation logic to convert only valid 10-digit entries into international format by appending the country code, ensuring CRM compatibility 

 After that, I copied the cleaned column, pasted *Values* over the original phone column and went ahead to delete the helper column.

e. I Validated order dates by distinguishing numeric Excel dates from text-based dates, converting valid DD/MM/YYYY strings, and blanking invalid or malformed entries using nested Excel logic, ensuring consistency for reporting and CRM imports.

f. Safely deduplicated the 1250 records by the  email address column as the unique identifier. Out of the 1250 records, 1150 duplicate records were removed and just 100 unique records were preserved.

g. *Applied accuracy checks to prevent recurring errors:* Standardized validation outputs by trimming possible whitespace and normalizing text values prior to calculating date, email address and phone number accuracy, ensuring consistent and reliable quality metrics.

h. Productivity metrics were estimated using timed data-entry simulations to mirror real-world workflows.
